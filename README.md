## Description

*** SECURITY UPDATE *** if you connect your Mailjet account and get a "php_network_getaddresses: getaddrinfo failed" or if you try to open "contacts", "statistics" and the login form appears AND your Mailjet account was created prior to August 2014, please go to [Account API keys](https://www.mailjet.com/account/api_keys) to regenerate a new Secret Key for the plug-in.

Mailjet's official plugin for DotClear will allow you to:

* Send transactional emails over Mailjet's enhanced SMTP relay from your DotClear site for advanced deliverability and tracking
* To easily create contact lists and manage personalisation variables;
* Have the insight you need from a real-time dashboard showing opens, clicks, geographies, average time to click, user agents, etc;
* Easily create and send marketing campaigns using drag and drop Newsletter builder or selecting from our template library;
* Provide a signup widget, so your visitors can sign up to your Mailjet mailing lists.

### Secure & real-time SMTP relay for all your emails
- A lot of features and plugins from your DotClear site send email notifications. All these messages are very important for your users, as well as for your business. Therefore, you want to track success and ensure a successful delivery.

### Sign up form & contact lists Management
-  Another great feature of this plugin is the sign up form Widget. It allows your site visitors to join your Mailjet lists. You can create contact lists directly from the plugin dashboard. The Widget will let you add forms to any post or any page.

### Mailjet’s latest generation v3 iframes
-  Last but not least, the plugin features Mailjet’s latest v3 iframes to manage contacts, create drag-and-drop marketing campaigns and view in depth sending statistics directly from within the plug-in.
